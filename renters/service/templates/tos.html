InsuranceMate, Inc. ("InsuranceMate") offers services (the "InsuranceMate Services") through which you can (i) sell certain consumer electronic products (the "Products") after receiving an "offer" from InsuranceMate by identifying your Product and its condition and completing check-out on the InsuranceMate Websites (each transaction, a “Borrow”) and (ii) buy Products (each sale, a “Purchase”). You must agree to abide by the following terms in order to use the InsuranceMate Services and/or the InsuranceMate Websites.
BY SETTING UP AN ACCOUNT, OR BY USING InsuranceMate'S WEB SITES, YOU SIGNIFY THAT YOU AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS, WHICH MAY BE AMENDED AT ANY TIME BY POSTING THE AMENDED TERMS ON THE InsuranceMate WEBSITES. ANY AMENDED TERMS WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY AFTER THEY ARE POSTED. InsuranceMate reserves the right to terminate or suspend your use of the InsuranceMate Websites and/or the InsuranceMate Services if you do not comply with this Agreement or any other InsuranceMate policy or procedure, or for any other reason we determine, in our sole discretion.

1. About These Terms. These terms govern (i) any offer that you receive to sell your Product to or through InsuranceMate and (ii) any Product you purchase from InsuranceMate. These terms, the terms that govern your use of InsuranceMate’s web sites, including getInsuranceMate.com and buy.getInsuranceMate.com ("InsuranceMate Websites"), the InsuranceMate Services and any and all applications included therein, which terms are located at www.getInsuranceMate.com/legal, the terms of InsuranceMate’s privacy disclosures located at www.getInsuranceMate.com/privacy_policy and any supplemental terms or policies that accompany a specific transaction, feature or application collectively make up an agreement between you and InsuranceMate (the "Agreement"). You acknowledge that this Agreement is in electronic form and has the same force and effect as an agreement in writing. In this Agreement, the term "you" or "your" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this Agreement, and the term "InsuranceMate," "we" or "us" means InsuranceMate and its affiliates and subsidiaries.

2. Requirements for Borrow and Purchase. In order to complete a Borrow or Purchase or to complete any other transaction with InsuranceMate, you must:  (i) Create an account with us (Borrow transaction only);  (ii) Provide true, up to date and accurate account information about yourself and any Product you submit to us or Purchase from us;  (iii) Comply with all terms and conditions of this Agreement;  (iv) Comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including all import and export laws as described in Section 15 below;  (v) Transact on behalf of yourself and not on behalf of others; and  (vi) Be over eighteen (18) years of age and have the legal capacity to enter into agreements and to convey title and interest in any Product that you submit to us.

3. In order to receive payments for any Products in connection with a Borrow, you must provide us with information including a valid email address at which you are able to receive email, a valid postal address at which you are able to receive mail, and your first and last name. In order to receive any Product you Purchase, you must provide us with information including first and last name, email address at which you receive email, phone number, billing address, and a valid postal address at which you are able to receive mail (if different from the billing address). On InsuranceMate’s behalf, PayPal will process your payment for a Purchase and you are required to provide your applicable credit card number, expiration date and CVV code (unless you are paying for the Purchase using your PayPal account). InsuranceMate will not receive or store your credit card information.

4. InsuranceMate shall not be responsible for communication errors should your contact information be in accurate or incomplete. You are responsible for ensuring that you can receive emails from InsuranceMate and InsuranceMate is not responsible for any emails that were not received by you because they were blocked or filtered as spam. You understand and agree that if you fail to provide us with accurate and up to date information about yourself: (a) we will not be responsible for any misapplied Borrow payments or Borrow payments sent to a wrong address, and (b) any unclaimed funds may be subject to collection by governmental authorities under applicable unclaimed funds and escheat laws. You agree that we have no obligation to you if any of your unclaimed funds are turned over to governmental authorities in accordance with applicable law.

5. The following terms also apply to any Purchase transaction:

6. Credit Card – Your credit card will be charged by InsuranceMate when your order is placed, unless you choose to pay with your PayPal account.

7. Sales Tax – State Sales Tax will apply to all items shipped to Florida, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Washington or any other jurisdiction in which we are legally obligated to collect sales tax.

8. Shipping - Shipping is not free. InsuranceMate provides fixed, leveled prices associated with ground, expedited, and next day shipping. Shipping is provided by either FedEx or UPS.

9. Returns - You must return InsuranceMate’s device within the time specified. Your credit card will be automatically billed for the next cycle when your device is not returned within the current cycle. The return date will be recognized as the date InsuranceMate receive your device.

10. Consumables - Consumables such as batteries have a limited lifespan and may not function in a like-new manner. Please be aware that some devices require service, carrier service contracts and/or data plans in order for the Product to be fully functional. These services and plans are not included in the purchase price and are not provided by InsuranceMate unless and until separately offered and purchased.

11. Product Pricing - InsuranceMate regularly adjusts prices based on a variety of factors, including market conditions and individual Product condition, and therefore does not price match other Product sellers and does not provide price adjustments once a payment is complete. Prices for the same or similar Products may vary between the InsuranceMate Websites and third-party marketplaces like eBay or Amazon.

12. Product Availability – Products are not guaranteed to be available until the order for Purchase is accepted by InsuranceMate and confirmed on the applicable InsuranceMate Website. Notwithstanding the foregoing, InsuranceMate reserves the right to cancel any order for Purchase at any time prior to delivery of the Product for any reason.

13. Out-of-Stock Products – If InsuranceMate no longer carries a Product that is sent in for replacement, or if that Product is simply out of stock, you will be notified via email of two options: 1) InsuranceMate can send you a comparable replacement item, or 2) InsuranceMate can issue you a refund at the current market value of the Product. A current-market-value refund may not exceed the original purchase price. If the item is returned within 30 days of the original invoice date, a full refund will be issued.

14. Maximum Product Quantity – InsuranceMate does not permit more than three (3) Product purchases per transaction. If you are interested in purchasing a greater quantity, please contact Customer Care.

15. Partial Order Fulfillment – If an order can only be partially filled, all available Products will ship and InsuranceMate will reimburse the different to the original method of payment.

16. Technical Support – InsuranceMate does not provide any technical or other support in connection with any Product offered for sale. You are responsible for all Product use and set up.

17. Product Eligibility. InsuranceMate determines, in its sole discretion, which Products are eligible for purchase or sale by or through the InsuranceMate Services and InsuranceMate Websites and for which eligible Products InsuranceMate will provide an offer or sell. InsuranceMate may terminate the eligibility of certain Products at any time and without advanced notice, but such termination will not affect any Products for which you have already accepted an offer, which is good for thirty (30) days, except as set forth in Section 9 below. InsuranceMate reserves the right to cancel any Purchase and refund any applicable purchase price actually received by InsuranceMate at any time prior to delivery of the Product to You.

18. InsuranceMate offers two (2) Product conditions for Purchase: (i) "InsuranceMate Certified Good", which means all Product features work (except for those requiring carrier service or data plans, which must be purchased separately if so desired) and the device may include minor scratches; and “InsuranceMate Certified Like New”, which means all Product features work (as noted above) and is cosmetically like new. All Products available for Purchase are, where applicable, eligible for activation on the carrier network identified for that particular device.

19. Product Valuation. All offers will be based on InsuranceMate's own determination of the Product value in reliance on the accuracy of the information you supply us. InsuranceMate will use its discretion to determine the Product value, weighing factors that may include the Product's model, functionality and condition and whether necessary Product accessories have been provided by you. Upon receiving an offer, you have the option of accepting or rejecting that offer. Acceptance indicates you are willing to provide your Product to InsuranceMate at the offered price. If you do not accept InsuranceMate’s offer, the specific transaction expires. If after rejecting the offer you change your mind and want to accept the offer, you will need to open another transaction with us at which point, assuming the Product is still eligible for purchase, the new offer may be different as Product prices are subject to change.

20. Fitness for Sale; Phone and Internet Service. You must have all right, title, and interest in any and all Products you seek to sell to InsuranceMate and all Products must be able to be activated for new service (unless the Product is incapable of being activated because it is in “Broken” condition). The Products and the sale and shipment of such items to InsuranceMate: (a) must comply with all applicable laws, statutes, ordinances, including without limitation all import and export laws as described in Section 14 below, (b) may not infringe on third party intellectual property rights (including copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets or other proprietary rights), and (c) shall not be counterfeit, stolen, or fraudulent. You represent and warrant that the Products are free of any liens or encumbrances, including third-party software which may not be transferred or for which royalties are due. By using the InsuranceMate Services, you agree to indemnify InsuranceMate from all claims or losses sustained by InsuranceMate as a result of any breach of these representations and warranties. It is your responsibility to discontinue phone, Internet and/or any similar service on your Product prior to selling it to InsuranceMate. InsuranceMate is not responsible for any service charges related to your Product, whether you incur such charges before, during or after your use of the Services. It is also your responsibility to remove any security codes that would prevent use of any Product.

21. Use of Services. By using InsuranceMate Websites, you agree not to (i) access any of the Services by any means (including, without limitation, by use of scripts, web crawlers or similar methods) other than through the user interface provided by InsuranceMate; and (ii) engage in any other activity that interferes with or disrupts the Services or performance of the InsuranceMate Websites.

Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability of consequential or incidental damages, so the above exclusions may not apply to all users; in such states liability is limited to the fullest extent permitted by law.

24. Indemnity. You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless InsuranceMate, its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, vendors and distributors from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, expenses, or fees (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) that such parties may incur as a result of or arising from your (or anyone using your account’s) violation or breach of any terms under this Agreement. We reserve the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you and, in such case, you agree to cooperate with our defense of such claim.

25. Entire Agreement/No Waiver. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. The captions are used only as a matter of convenience and are not to be considered a part of this agreement or be used in determining the intent of the parties to it. No waiver by InsuranceMate of any breach or default hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default. Sections 6, 8, 11, 13, 15, 18, 19 and 22 through 28 shall survive termination of this Agreement.

26. Correction of Errors and Inaccuracies.

InsuranceMate does not, however, guarantee that any errors, inaccuracies, or omissions will be corrected.

If you do not agree to the changes, you may discontinue using the InsuranceMate Websites and/or the InsuranceMate Services. Your continued use of any InsuranceMate Website and/or InsuranceMate Services after any such changes take effect constitutes your acceptance to such changes. Each time you submit a Product for sale to InsuranceMate, you reaffirm your acceptance of this Agreement as in effect at the time of such use.
