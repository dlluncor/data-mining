  	<pre>

RentSafe, Inc. ("RentSafe") offers services (the "RentSafe Services") through which you can (i) sell certain consumer electronic products (the "Products") after receiving an "offer" from RentSafe by identifying your Product and its condition and completing check-out on the RentSafe Websites (each transaction, a “Borrow”) and (ii) buy Products (each sale, a “Purchase”). You must agree to abide by the following terms in order to use the RentSafe Services and/or the RentSafe Websites.
BY SETTING UP AN ACCOUNT, OR BY USING RentSafe'S WEB SITES, YOU SIGNIFY THAT YOU AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS, WHICH MAY BE AMENDED AT ANY TIME BY POSTING THE AMENDED TERMS ON THE RentSafe WEBSITES. ANY AMENDED TERMS WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY AFTER THEY ARE POSTED. RentSafe reserves the right to terminate or suspend your use of the RentSafe Websites and/or the RentSafe Services if you do not comply with this Agreement or any other RentSafe policy or procedure, or for any other reason we determine, in our sole discretion.

1. About These Terms. These terms govern (i) any offer that you receive to sell your Product to or through RentSafe and (ii) any Product you purchase from RentSafe. These terms, the terms that govern your use of RentSafe’s web sites, including getRentSafe.com and buy.getRentSafe.com ("RentSafe Websites"), the RentSafe Services and any and all applications included therein, which terms are located at rentsafe.co/legal, the terms of RentSafe’s privacy disclosures located at rentsafe.co/privacy_policy and any supplemental terms or policies that accompany a specific transaction, feature or application collectively make up an agreement between you and RentSafe (the "Agreement"). You acknowledge that this Agreement is in electronic form and has the same force and effect as an agreement in writing. In this Agreement, the term "you" or "your" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this Agreement, and the term "RentSafe," "we" or "us" means RentSafe and its affiliates and subsidiaries.

2. Requirements for Borrow and Purchase. In order to complete a Borrow or Purchase or to complete any other transaction with RentSafe, you must:  (i) Create an account with us (Borrow transaction only);  (ii) Provide true, up to date and accurate account information about yourself and any Product you submit to us or Purchase from us;  (iii) Comply with all terms and conditions of this Agreement;  (iv) Comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including all import and export laws as described in Section 15 below;  (v) Transact on behalf of yourself and not on behalf of others; and  (vi) Be over eighteen (18) years of age and have the legal capacity to enter into agreements and to convey title and interest in any Product that you submit to us.

3. In order to receive payments for any Products in connection with a Borrow, you must provide us with information including a valid email address at which you are able to receive email, a valid postal address at which you are able to receive mail, and your first and last name. In order to receive any Product you Purchase, you must provide us with information including first and last name, email address at which you receive email, phone number, billing address, and a valid postal address at which you are able to receive mail (if different from the billing address). On RentSafe’s behalf, PayPal will process your payment for a Purchase and you are required to provide your applicable credit card number, expiration date and CVV code (unless you are paying for the Purchase using your PayPal account). RentSafe will not receive or store your credit card information.

4. RentSafe shall not be responsible for communication errors should your contact information be in accurate or incomplete. You are responsible for ensuring that you can receive emails from RentSafe and RentSafe is not responsible for any emails that were not received by you because they were blocked or filtered as spam. You understand and agree that if you fail to provide us with accurate and up to date information about yourself: (a) we will not be responsible for any misapplied Borrow payments or Borrow payments sent to a wrong address, and (b) any unclaimed funds may be subject to collection by governmental authorities under applicable unclaimed funds and escheat laws. You agree that we have no obligation to you if any of your unclaimed funds are turned over to governmental authorities in accordance with applicable law.

5. The following terms also apply to any Purchase transaction:

6. Credit Card – Your credit card will be charged by RentSafe when your order is placed, unless you choose to pay with your PayPal account.

7. Sales Tax – State Sales Tax will apply to all items shipped to Florida, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Washington or any other jurisdiction in which we are legally obligated to collect sales tax.

8. Shipping - Shipping is not free. RentSafe provides fixed, leveled prices associated with ground, expedited, and next day shipping. Shipping is provided by either FedEx or UPS.

9. Returns - You must return RentSafe’s device within the time specified. Your credit card will be automatically billed for the next cycle when your device is not returned within the current cycle. The return date will be recognized as the date RentSafe receive your device.

10. Consumables - Consumables such as batteries have a limited lifespan and may not function in a like-new manner. Please be aware that some devices require service, carrier service contracts and/or data plans in order for the Product to be fully functional. These services and plans are not included in the purchase price and are not provided by RentSafe unless and until separately offered and purchased.

11. Product Pricing - RentSafe regularly adjusts prices based on a variety of factors, including market conditions and individual Product condition, and therefore does not price match other Product sellers and does not provide price adjustments once a payment is complete. Prices for the same or similar Products may vary between the RentSafe Websites and third-party marketplaces like eBay or Amazon.

12. Product Availability – Products are not guaranteed to be available until the order for Purchase is accepted by RentSafe and confirmed on the applicable RentSafe Website. Notwithstanding the foregoing, RentSafe reserves the right to cancel any order for Purchase at any time prior to delivery of the Product for any reason.

13. Out-of-Stock Products – If RentSafe no longer carries a Product that is sent in for replacement, or if that Product is simply out of stock, you will be notified via email of two options: 1) RentSafe can send you a comparable replacement item, or 2) RentSafe can issue you a refund at the current market value of the Product. A current-market-value refund may not exceed the original purchase price. If the item is returned within 30 days of the original invoice date, a full refund will be issued.

14. Maximum Product Quantity – RentSafe does not permit more than three (3) Product purchases per transaction. If you are interested in purchasing a greater quantity, please contact Customer Care.

15. Partial Order Fulfillment – If an order can only be partially filled, all available Products will ship and RentSafe will reimburse the different to the original method of payment.

16. Technical Support – RentSafe does not provide any technical or other support in connection with any Product offered for sale. You are responsible for all Product use and set up.

17. Product Eligibility. RentSafe determines, in its sole discretion, which Products are eligible for purchase or sale by or through the RentSafe Services and RentSafe Websites and for which eligible Products RentSafe will provide an offer or sell. RentSafe may terminate the eligibility of certain Products at any time and without advanced notice, but such termination will not affect any Products for which you have already accepted an offer, which is good for thirty (30) days, except as set forth in Section 9 below. RentSafe reserves the right to cancel any Purchase and refund any applicable purchase price actually received by RentSafe at any time prior to delivery of the Product to You.

18. RentSafe offers two (2) Product conditions for Purchase: (i) "RentSafe Certified Good", which means all Product features work (except for those requiring carrier service or data plans, which must be purchased separately if so desired) and the device may include minor scratches; and “RentSafe Certified Like New”, which means all Product features work (as noted above) and is cosmetically like new. All Products available for Purchase are, where applicable, eligible for activation on the carrier network identified for that particular device.

19. Product Valuation. All offers will be based on RentSafe's own determination of the Product value in reliance on the accuracy of the information you supply us. RentSafe will use its discretion to determine the Product value, weighing factors that may include the Product's model, functionality and condition and whether necessary Product accessories have been provided by you. Upon receiving an offer, you have the option of accepting or rejecting that offer. Acceptance indicates you are willing to provide your Product to RentSafe at the offered price. If you do not accept RentSafe’s offer, the specific transaction expires. If after rejecting the offer you change your mind and want to accept the offer, you will need to open another transaction with us at which point, assuming the Product is still eligible for purchase, the new offer may be different as Product prices are subject to change.

20. Fitness for Sale; Phone and Internet Service. You must have all right, title, and interest in any and all Products you seek to sell to RentSafe and all Products must be able to be activated for new service (unless the Product is incapable of being activated because it is in “Broken” condition). The Products and the sale and shipment of such items to RentSafe: (a) must comply with all applicable laws, statutes, ordinances, including without limitation all import and export laws as described in Section 14 below, (b) may not infringe on third party intellectual property rights (including copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets or other proprietary rights), and (c) shall not be counterfeit, stolen, or fraudulent. You represent and warrant that the Products are free of any liens or encumbrances, including third-party software which may not be transferred or for which royalties are due. By using the RentSafe Services, you agree to indemnify RentSafe from all claims or losses sustained by RentSafe as a result of any breach of these representations and warranties. It is your responsibility to discontinue phone, Internet and/or any similar service on your Product prior to selling it to RentSafe. RentSafe is not responsible for any service charges related to your Product, whether you incur such charges before, during or after your use of the Services. It is also your responsibility to remove any security codes that would prevent use of any Product.

21. Use of Services. By using RentSafe Websites, you agree not to (i) access any of the Services by any means (including, without limitation, by use of scripts, web crawlers or similar methods) other than through the user interface provided by RentSafe; and (ii) engage in any other activity that interferes with or disrupts the Services or performance of the RentSafe Websites.

22. No Warranties. WE PROVIDE THE RentSafe SERVICES AND WEBSITES "AS IS," "WITH ALL FAULTS," AND "AS AVAILABLE," WITHOUT EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. WE DISCLAIM ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, ACCURACY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT AND THE IMPLIED CONDITIONS OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY. WE MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS THAT YOUR TRANSACTIONS WITH RentSafe WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS.

23. Limited Liability. IN NO EVENT SHALL RentSafe, ITS DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AFFILIATES, AGENTS OR CONTRACTORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY COMPENSATORY, DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, LOSS OF DATA, INCOME OR PROFIT, LOSS OF OR DAMAGE TO PROPERTY, OR ANY CLAIMS OF YOU OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES WHATSOEVER WITH RESPECT TO YOUR TRANSACTIONS WITH RentSafe UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability of consequential or incidental damages, so the above exclusions may not apply to all users; in such states liability is limited to the fullest extent permitted by law.

24. Indemnity. You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless RentSafe, its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, vendors and distributors from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, expenses, or fees (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) that such parties may incur as a result of or arising from your (or anyone using your account’s) violation or breach of any terms under this Agreement. We reserve the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you and, in such case, you agree to cooperate with our defense of such claim.

25. Entire Agreement/No Waiver. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. The captions are used only as a matter of convenience and are not to be considered a part of this agreement or be used in determining the intent of the parties to it. No waiver by RentSafe of any breach or default hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default. Sections 6, 8, 11, 13, 15, 18, 19 and 22 through 28 shall survive termination of this Agreement.

26. Correction of Errors and Inaccuracies. The RentSafe Website and any correspondence related to a transaction may contain typographical errors or other errors or inaccuracies and may not be complete or current. RentSafe therefore reserves the right to correct any errors, inaccuracies or omissions and to change or update the Content at any time without prior notice. RentSafe does not, however, guarantee that any errors, inaccuracies, or omissions will be corrected.

27. Modification. RentSafe reserves the right to modify this Agreement at any time. If you do not agree to the changes, you may discontinue using the RentSafe Websites and/or the RentSafe Services. Your continued use of any RentSafe Website and/or RentSafe Services after any such changes take effect constitutes your acceptance to such changes. Each time you submit a Product for sale to RentSafe, you reaffirm your acceptance of this Agreement as in effect at the time of such use. You are responsible for reviewing this Agreement each time you use the RentSafe Websites and/or the RentSafe Websites. The Agreement is and will be located at rentsafe.co/ main/service_terms. The last date this Agreement was revised is set forth below. Terms and conditions modifying the Agreement are effective immediately upon posting.

28. Applicable Law and Venue. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TERMS OF SALE AND TRANSFER OF TITLE OF YOUR PRODUCT ARE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH MASSACHUSETTS LAW AND TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE, THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES. NO CONFLICT OF LAWS OR PROVISIONS OF ANY JURISDICTION WILL APPLY TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS. BY CLICKING ON THE "ACCEPT" BUTTON BELOW, YOU AGREE THAT ANY ACTION AT LAW OR INEQUITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS WILL BE FILED ONLY IN STATE OR FEDERAL COURT LOCATED IN BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS, AND YOU HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY CONSENT AND SUBMIT TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS OVER ANY SUIT, ACTION, OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
